# Phenopacket-schema FHIR interoperability library
Interoperability library for Phenopackets schema and FHIRÂ® standard

# Purpose
This library is an example library showing how to convert FHIR bundles into a PhenoPacket. The conversion is lossy as the focus of each standard is somewhat different.

This library uses FHIR DSTU3 and the Phenopacket-schema v1.
